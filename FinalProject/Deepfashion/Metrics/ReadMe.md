## FID Score and Dice Score: Evaluating Generated Image Quality
### Introduction
The FID (Frechet Inception Distance) score and Dice score are both metrics used to evaluate the quality of generated images, but they serve different purposes.

### FID Score
#### Purpose
The FID score measures the similarity between two distributions of images (e.g., real and generated images). A lower FID score indicates that the generated images are more similar to the real images.

#### Calculation
To calculate the FID score, you need to:
1. **Extract features**: Extract features from the real and generated images using a pre-trained CNN (e.g., Inception-V3).
2. **Calculate mean and covariance**: Calculate the mean and covariance of the features for both distributions.
3. **Compute FID score**: Compute the FID score using the following formula:

FID = ||μ1 - μ2||^2 + Tr(Σ1 + Σ2 - 2(Σ1 Σ2)^1/2)
where μ1 and μ2 are the mean features, Σ1 and Σ2 are the covariance matrices, and Tr() is the trace operator.

### Dice Score
#### Purpose
The Dice score (also known as the Sørensen–Dice coefficient) measures the similarity between two images in terms of their semantic content. It's commonly used to evaluate the performance of image segmentation models.

#### Calculation
To calculate the Dice score, you need to:
1. **Segment images**: Segment the images into regions of interest (e.g., objects, classes).
2. **Calculate intersection and union**: Calculate the intersection and union of the segmented regions.
3. **Compute Dice score**: Compute the Dice score using the following formula:

Dice = 2 * (intersection) / (union + intersection)

A higher Dice score indicates better segmentation performance.
